# PortfolioPage_JA
This is my portfolio page created to display my portfolio, resume, contact info, and additional information. It will be updated as I learn more about coding.

<-- About -->
This portfolio page consists of a navigation bar linking to three sections within the body of the website. The navigation bar links to the About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Me. 

The About Me section explains who I am, what I would like to achieve and provides a picture of myself. 

The Portfolio section provides links to my recent projects and my premier project that I would like to have the most attention to. Please note that three slots are empty as of now because I have only done two major projects/homework worth including on my page. 

The Contact Me provides a sample phone number, my personal e-mail (subject to change), and a link that directs you to my Github.

1. My first difficulty making this page was how to insert a background image within the navigation bar. The image was oversized and I could not figure out how to resize and crop to its desired look. I left this project for another time and moved on.

2. My second difficulty was the list items in the Contact Me section. The list items had no spacing in between each other. It took me a little more time than expected to fix the problem and add the spacing I wanted between each list item. I had to alter the <*ul> and change its width while also adding padding to the <*li> to achieve the desired look.
